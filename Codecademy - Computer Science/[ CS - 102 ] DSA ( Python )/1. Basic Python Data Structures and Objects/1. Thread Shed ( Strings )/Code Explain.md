Code explanation

The selected code block performs the following actions:

1. Replaces the delimiter ;,; with @ in the daily_sales string.
2. Splits the daily_sales_replaced string into a list of transactions using the , delimiter.
3. Splits each transaction in the daily_transactions list into a sublist using the @ delimiter.
4. Cleans up each transaction by removing newline characters and extra spaces.
5. Extracts the customer, sale, and thread sold from each cleaned transaction and stores them in separate lists.
6. Calculates the total sales by summing up the values in the sales list.
7. Splits each thread sold into individual colors and stores them in the thread_sold_split list.
8. Defines a color_count function that counts the occurrences of a specific color in the thread_sold_split list.
9. Iterates over a list of colors and prints the count of each color sold at the Thread Shed.

The code allows you to analyze the daily sales and thread inventory at the Thread Shed store. It replaces the delimiter used in the sales data, extracts relevant information into separate lists, calculates total sales, and counts the occurrence of each color sold. Finally, it displays the count for each color.
