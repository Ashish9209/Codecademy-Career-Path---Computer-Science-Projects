Code explanation

The selected code block performs the following tasks:

1. It defines two lists: letters and points. These lists contain corresponding letters of the alphabet and their corresponding point values in the game.
2. It creates a dictionary called letter_to_points using a dictionary comprehension. This dictionary maps each letter to its corresponding point value.
3. It adds a key-value pair to letter_to_points dictionary to account for spaces (" "), assigning it a point value of 0.
4. It defines a function called score_word that takes a word as input. It initializes a variable point_total to 0.
5. Inside the function, it iterates over each letter in the word and adds its corresponding point value to point_total using letter_to_points.get(letter, 0). If the letter is not found in the letter_to_points dictionary, it defaults to 0.
6. The function returns the final point_total for the word.
7. It creates a dictionary called player_to_words that maps each player’s name to a list of words they played.
8. It creates an empty dictionary called player_to_points to store each player’s total points.
9. It iterates over each player and their associated list of words using player_to_words.items().
10. Inside the loop, it initializes player_points to 0 for each player.
11. It iterates over each word in the player’s list of words and adds the score for each word to player_points using the score_word function.
12. Finally, it assigns player_points to the corresponding player in the player_to_points dictionary.
13. The final point totals for each player are printed using print(player_to_points).


This code block allows you to calculate the point totals for different words and players in the game.
