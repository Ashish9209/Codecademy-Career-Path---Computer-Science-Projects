Code explanation

The selected code allows the user to interact with a story. It creates a TreeNode class that represents a piece of the story. Each TreeNode has a story_piece and a list of choices. The traverse method is used to navigate through the story based on user input.

The program starts by creating the root TreeNode with the initial story piece. Then, it creates other TreeNode instances representing different choices in the story. Each choice is added to the choices list of a parent TreeNode using the add_child method.

To traverse the story, the program starts with the story_root node, displays its story_piece, and asks the user to input a choice (1 or 2). If the user enters an invalid choice, a message is displayed. If the user enters a valid choice, the corresponding child TreeNode is selected and its story_piece is displayed. This process continues until there are no more choices.

To interact with the story, you can uncomment the last line (# print(story_root.story_piece)) to print the initial story piece.

Overall, the code allows the user to experience an interactive story by selecting choices and progressing through different story paths.
