Code explanation

The selected code block prints the value of the ‘author’ key for each book in the ‘long_bookshelf’ list.

1. The for loop iterates through each book in the ‘long_bookshelf’ list.
2. The loop then prints the value corresponding to the ‘author’ key using the statement print(book['author']).

This code helps display the authors of the books in the ‘long_bookshelf’ list.
