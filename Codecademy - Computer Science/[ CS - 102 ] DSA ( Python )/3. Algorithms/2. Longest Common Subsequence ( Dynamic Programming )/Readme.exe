Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings: "ABAZDC" and "BACBAD", how can we determine the longest common subsequence?

In other words, what series of letters from left to right do they share? The letters don’t need to be directly next to each other. In this example, the longest sequence is "ABAD" for a length of 4.

Longest Common Subsequence may seem like an obscure problem, but it has applications in genomics. “A”, “C”, “G”, and “T” represent the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand. The longest common subsequence of among these letters would provide valuable information about two people’s genetics.
