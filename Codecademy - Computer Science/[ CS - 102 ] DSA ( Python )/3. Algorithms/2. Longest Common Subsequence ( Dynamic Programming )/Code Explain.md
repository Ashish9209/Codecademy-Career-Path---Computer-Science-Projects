Code explanation

The selected code in the given program calculates the longest common subsequence between two DNA strings. It does this by using a dynamic programming approach. The code initializes a 2D grid to store the lengths of common subsequences. It then iterates through each character of the strings, comparing them. If the characters are the same, the length of the subsequence is incremented. Otherwise, the length is determined by taking the maximum of the previous rows or columns. After all iterations, the grid represents the lengths of the longest common subsequences. The resulting DNA sequence is printed and returned.
