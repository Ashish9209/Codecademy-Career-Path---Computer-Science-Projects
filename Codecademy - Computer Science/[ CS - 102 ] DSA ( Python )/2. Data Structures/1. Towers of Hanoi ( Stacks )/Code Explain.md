Code explanation

The selected code performs the core logic of the Towers of Hanoi game. It allows the user to move disks between stacks until they successfully move all the disks to the right stack.

The code starts by setting up the game, including creating three stacks(named left_stack, middle_stack, right_stack), and initializing them with disks based on user input.

Next, the code calculates the optimal number of moves required to solve the game and prints it.

Then, the code enters a loop where the user can make moves. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to select a stack to move from and a stack to move to. It validates the userâ€™s move and updates the stacks accordingly.

The loop continues until all the disks are successfully moved to the right stack.

Finally, the code prints a message displaying the number of moves the user took to complete the game and the optimal number of moves.

You can try running the code and play the Towers of Hanoi game! Have fun!
