This Python code defines an UltraSuperCalculator class that simulates a processor designed for a four-function calculator using a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The calculator operates on 32-bit binary instructions and has specific rules and capabilities:

1. **System Design**: It functions as a four-function calculator that operates only on numbers stored in registers. Results are returned to the terminal.
   
2. **Instruction Format**: Each instruction is 32 bits long and is parsed based on predefined bit fields:
   - **OPCODE (bits 0-5)**: Determines the operation to be performed.
   - **Source Registers (bits 6-10 and 11-15)**: Identify the registers containing operands.
   - **Store (bits 16-25)**: Specifies a new value to be stored in registers.
   - **Function Code (bits 26-31)**: Specifies the arithmetic operation to perform.

3. **Registers**: There are 32 registers in total:
   - Registers 0-21 are available for number storage (with Register 0 holding constant 0).
   - Registers 22-31 are used for storing history or temporary values.

4. **Operations**: Supported operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation retrieves operands from specified source registers, performs the computation, and stores the result back into a register. Division checks for division by zero.

5. **History and Display**: Results of operations are stored in history registers and can be recalled using a special opcode. The calculator maintains a display that updates with each operation's result or error message.

6. **Usage Example**: The provided code demonstrates storing values, performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and retrieving the last calculated results from history registers.

This implementation serves as a simplified model of a processor architecture tailored for basic arithmetic operations and demonstrates how instructions are decoded and executed within such a system.
