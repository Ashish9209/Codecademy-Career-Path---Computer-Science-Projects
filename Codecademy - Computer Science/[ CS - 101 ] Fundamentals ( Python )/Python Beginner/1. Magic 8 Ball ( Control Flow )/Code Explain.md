Code explanation

The selected code block determines a random answer from a Magic 8-Ball toy in response to a question. It imports the random module and assigns a question to the variable question. It generates a random number between 1 and 9 and assigns it to random_number. Based on the value of random_number, it assigns an answer to the answer variable using if and elif statements. Finally, it prints the name, question, and the Magic 8-Ballâ€™s answer.
