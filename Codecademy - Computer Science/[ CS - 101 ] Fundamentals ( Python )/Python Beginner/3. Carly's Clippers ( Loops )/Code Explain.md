Code explanation

The selected code block is responsible for calculating and managing prices and revenue related to a hair salon.

First, the code calculates the total price of all haircuts by iterating through the prices list and adding each price to the total_price variable. Then, it prints the total price.

Next, the code calculates the average haircut price by dividing the total_price by the total number of hairstyles (8). It then prints the average price.

The code then creates a new list called new_prices by subtracting 5 from each price in the prices list. It prints the new prices.

After that, the code calculates the total revenue by multiplying each price in the prices list with the corresponding number of haircuts from the last_week list, and summing all the results in the total_revenue variable.

Next, the code calculates the average daily revenue by dividing the total_revenue by 7 (the number of days in a week). It then prints the average daily revenue.

Finally, the code creates a list called cuts_under_30 that includes the hairstyles from the hairstyles list for which the corresponding price in the new_prices list is less than 30.

The code then prints the cuts_under_30 list.

This code block provides information on pricing, revenue, and hairstyles that fall under a certain price range.
