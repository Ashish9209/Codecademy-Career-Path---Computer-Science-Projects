Code explanation

The selected code block defines several functions and performs calculations using those functions.

First, the f_to_c function converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius. Next, the c_to_f function converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. Then, the get_force function calculates the force by multiplying the mass and acceleration. After that, the get_energy function calculates the energy by multiplying the mass with 3*10^8. Lastly, the get_work function calculates the work by multiplying the force and distance.

These functions are then used to calculate and print the temperature conversions, the force, the bomb energy, and the train work.
