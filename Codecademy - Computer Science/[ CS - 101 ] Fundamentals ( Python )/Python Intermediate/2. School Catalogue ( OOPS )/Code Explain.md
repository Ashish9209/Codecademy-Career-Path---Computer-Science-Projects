This Python code defines three classes: `School`, `PrimarySchool`, and `HighSchool`, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism.

The `School` class has attributes `name`, `level`, and `numberOfStudents`, along with methods to get and set these attributes (`get_name`, `get_level`, `get_numberOfStudents`, `set_numberOfStudents`). The `__repr__` method provides a string representation of the school object.

The `PrimarySchool` class inherits from `School` and adds an additional attribute `pickupPolicy`. Its constructor initializes the parent attributes using `super()` and adds `pickupPolicy`. The `__repr__` method overrides the parent's method to include the pickup policy information.

The `HighSchool` class similarly inherits from `School` and adds a variable number of `sportsTeams` as an attribute. Its constructor also uses `super()` to initialize the parent attributes and includes the sports teams. The `__repr__` method overrides the parent's method to display both the school's information and the sports teams.

Instances of each class (`ttic`, `rsbv`, `rskv`) are created and printed using `print()` statements, demonstrating polymorphic behavior through method overriding of `__repr__`. This results in formatted output describing each school instance based on its class and specific attributes:

```python
A Middle school named TTIC with 150 students.
A primary school named RSBV with 100 students. The pickup policy is pickup after 3pm.
A HighSchool school named RSKV with 115 students. The sports Team is ('cricket', 'football', 'vollyball').
```

Overall, this code illustrates how to use inheritance and method overriding in Python classes to create specialized subclasses (`PrimarySchool` and `HighSchool`) based on a generic `School` class.
