This code defines three functions: `calculate_shipping_cost`, `calculate_driver_cost`, and `calculate_money_made`. 

1. `calculate_shipping_cost(from_coords, to_coords, shipping_type='Overnight')`: This function calculates the shipping cost based on the distance between two coordinates (`from_coords` and `to_coords`). It uses the `get_distance` function from the `nile` module to compute the distance, and accesses a predefined dictionary `SHIPPING_PRICES` to get the shipping rate based on the specified `shipping_type`. It then computes the total price by multiplying distance and shipping rate, and returns the formatted price.

2. `calculate_driver_cost(distance, *drivers)`: This function calculates the cost for hiring a driver for a given distance. It takes multiple `drivers` as variable arguments (`*drivers`). For each driver, it calculates the time taken (`driver_time`) to cover the distance based on the driver's speed, then computes the cost (`price_for_driver`) as the product of the driver's hourly salary and the time taken. It determines the cheapest driver based on the computed cost and returns both the cost and the corresponding driver.

3. `calculate_money_made(**trips)`: This function calculates the total money made from a series of trips. It takes a variable number of trip objects (`**trips`), where each trip is identified by a unique `trip_id`. For each trip, it calculates the revenue (`trip_revenue`) by subtracting the driver's cost from the trip's total cost (`trip.cost - trip.driver.cost`). It accumulates these revenues to compute the `total_money_made` and returns this total.

Each function is tested using the `test_function` from the `test` module, ensuring that they perform correctly under specified test conditions.
