This Python code defines a program that manages guest lists and table assignments for an event. Initially, it reads guest data from a file (`guest_list.txt`) and stores it in a dictionary called `guests`. The `read_guestlist` function reads lines from the file, parses each line to extract guest names and ages, and populates the `guests` dictionary accordingly. The main program then demonstrates the use of generators and coroutines to manage guest lists and table assignments dynamically.

After reading the initial guest list, it prints the first 10 entries using `next(guest_list)`. It then uses `guest_list.send("Jane,35")` to add a new guest dynamically. Further calls to `next(guest_list)` print the next 4 entries from the updated guest list.

Next, it filters guests who are 21 years or older into a list called `guests_over_21`. It uses a generator expression to iterate over `guests` and filter based on age.

The program defines three generator functions (`table_1`, `table_2`, and `table_3`) that yield tuples containing food type, table number, and a sequence number for each table. These generators simulate different tables with specific food types.

The `combined_tables` generator uses `yield from` to concatenate results from `table_1`, `table_2`, and `table_3`.

The `assign_tables` generator function then assigns each guest from the `guests` dictionary to a table using `next(combined_tables)` and yields tuples pairing each guest with their assigned table details.

Finally, the main program iterates through `assign_tables` and prints each guest's name along with their assigned table details. This demonstrates dynamic guest list management, coroutine usage, and table assignment using generators in Python.
