This Python code defines unit tests for a surf shop's shopping cart functionality using the `unittest` framework. It first imports the `surfshop` module, which presumably contains the `ShoppingCart` class and possibly other components like exceptions (`TooManyBoardsError`). Inside the `test_surfshop` class derived from `unittest.TestCase`, several test methods are defined:

1. `setUp(self)`: Initializes a `ShoppingCart` instance (`self.cart`) before each test method runs.
  
2. `test_add_surfboards1(self)`: Tests adding 1 surfboard to the cart and checks if the correct success message is returned.

3. `test_add_surfboards2(self)`: Iterates over quantities 2, 3, and 4 to test adding multiple surfboards to the cart using `self.subTest()` for clear reporting. It verifies each addition and resets the cart after each iteration.

4. `test_too_many_boards(self)`: This test is currently skipped (`@unittest.skip`) but would verify that adding 5 surfboards raises a `TooManyBoardsError` as expected.

5. `test_locals_discount(self)`: Tests applying a local discount to the cart and verifies that the discount flag (`locals_discount`) is set to true.

Finally, `unittest.main()` runs all defined tests when the script is executed directly. Each test method checks different aspects of the `ShoppingCart` class to ensure correct behavior when adding surfboards and applying discounts, and handling exceptions when the cart exceeds its capacity.
