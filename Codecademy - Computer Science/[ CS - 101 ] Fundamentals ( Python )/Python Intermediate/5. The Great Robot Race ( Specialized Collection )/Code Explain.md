This Python script sets up and executes a robot race within a maze, defined by `maze_data_1.csv`. It uses several modules (`deque`, `Counter`, `namedtuple` from `collections`, `time`, and `sleep`). Initially, it reads and prints the maze, processes maze data to extract walls, goals, and robots, and initializes a deque for robot commands. The script then enters a loop, iterating through each robot to compute and enqueue their moves until the race is over or the maximum turns are reached. It counts the moves and collisions for each robot, and calculates their scores, storing this data in a namedtuple. A dictionary is maintained to track robot positions. The script moves robots according to the dequeued commands, updates the maze, and prints it at intervals, before finally printing the race results.
