This Python code defines a BankAccount class that simulates basic ATM operations. It begins by setting up logging to both a file ('formatted.log') and the console, formatting log messages with timestamps. The BankAccount class initializes with a balance of $100 and implements methods for authentication, deposit, withdrawal, and balance display. 

The `authenticate()` method asks the user for a PIN (hardcoded as 1234) and logs errors for invalid PIN entries. The `deposit()` method allows the user to add funds to their account, logging details of the transaction and handling errors for negative amounts or non-numeric inputs. Similarly, the `withdraw()` method enables withdrawing funds, logging transaction details and errors for insufficient funds or invalid inputs. Finally, the `display()` method prints the current balance. 

Overall, this code provides a simple ATM-like interface with basic security checks and logging capabilities for each financial transaction.
