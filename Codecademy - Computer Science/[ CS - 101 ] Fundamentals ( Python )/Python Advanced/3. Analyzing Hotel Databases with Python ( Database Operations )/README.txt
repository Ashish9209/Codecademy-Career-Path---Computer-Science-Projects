Analyzing Hotel Databases with Python


Sleep Away Inc., a hotel corporation, has just hired you as a data analyst. They would like you to analyze their most recent data about customers who cancelled their booking and customers who did not cancel.

It is your job to connect to Sleep Away’s SQLite database so you can edit and analyze the hotel_booking.db database. The company wants to learn about the BRA customers (Brazilian customers) who cancelled their bookings compared to the BRA customers who did not.

To do this, you will create a new data table in their database that only has the Brazilian customer hotel bookings. Once you create this new table and fill it with the BRA data, you will analyze it and report back to Sleep Away Inc. Lastly, don’t forget to commit these changes to the database and close the connection.
